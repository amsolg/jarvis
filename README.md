# Jarvis

Jarvis is an app for interacting with a personal knowledge base. It helps you store, organize, and retrieve your knowledge efficiently.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into two main sections:

1. **Codebase**: Contains the application code, including the backend, frontend, and other components necessary for the functioning of Jarvis.
2. **Knowledge Base**: Contains the structured knowledge organized using the PARA method.

## Jarvis: Your Context-Aware Persona

Jarvis features "Jarvis," a context-aware persona designed to help you manage your knowledge base:

- **Context Awareness**: Jarvis reacts based on your current context, providing relevant information when needed.
- **Knowledge Base Management**: Jarvis detects if anything you say is not already in the knowledge base and adds it accordingly.
- **PARA Method Structure**: All knowledge is structured using the PARA (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives) method for efficient organization.
- **Continuous Indexing**: When not actively interacting, Jarvis indexes new knowledge base content with embeddings for reliable and efficient retrieval.
- **Multiple Interaction Modes**: Interact with Jarvis via text or voice chat.
