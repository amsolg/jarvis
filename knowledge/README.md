## Structure

- `/projects`: Current projects with clear goals and deadlines
- `/areas`: Areas of responsibility requiring ongoing attention

## PARA Method

The PARA method organizes information into four categories:

1. **Projects**: Contains active projects with defined outcomes and deadlines
2. **Areas**: Represents responsibilities requiring ongoing maintenance
3. **Resources**: Topic-specific reference materials and information
4. **Archives**: Inactive and completed items from other categories
